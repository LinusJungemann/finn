    "*The task:* The goal of digit classification is to accurately identify handwritten digits from images, a fundamental task in computer vision and machine learning. This is particularly useful in applications such as automated postal code recognition, bank check processing, and digitizing handwritten documents. Machine learning (ML) techniques, especially deep learning, have proven to be highly effective in solving this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The dataset:* The MNIST dataset is one of the most well-known datasets for training and testing machine learning models on the task of handwritten digit recognition. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of digits ranging from 0 to 9. Each image is a grayscale 28x28 pixel image, making it relatively simple while still being a challenging task for learning algorithms. The MNIST dataset has become a standard benchmark for evaluating image classification algorithms and is widely used in academic research and practical applications. You can find more details about the dataset on [its homepage](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).\n",

    "*Performance considerations:* FPGAs are commonly used for implementing high-performance packet processing systems that still provide a degree of programmability. To avoid introducing bottlenecks on the network, the DNN implementation must be capable of detecting malicious ones at line rate, which can be millions of packets per second, and is expected to increase further as next-generation networking solutions provide increased\n",
